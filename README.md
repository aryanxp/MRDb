<h1 align="center">MRDb(Movie Review Database)</h1>

![Build status](https://github.com/aryanxp/MRDb/actions/workflows/codeql-analysis.yml/badge.svg)

Website which displays all latest trending movies and tv series reviews available on OTT platforms.

The database is used from TMDb.

I took help from YouTube and documentation of Next.js and TailwindCSS.

Website is live hosted on [Vercel](http://mrdb.vercel.app) and is constantly updated. Suggestions are most welcomed just mail me on aryanp@pm.me .




This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
